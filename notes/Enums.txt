Used to signal to other engineers that the data is closely related
Use when ever a small fixed set of values that are all closely related and known at compie time

In short you need to know the data ahead of time before you can use an enum, also it must not be too Brighton

eg, you know the genders, sizes (s, m, l) ahead of time but you do not know the different song titles
